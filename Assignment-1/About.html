                        I am a graduate member of Nigeria Institute of Managers(chartered). As member of this institute, I have had the privilege of working with a number of managers in some reputable firms. I had worked as staff in 7-up Bottling Company under the department of Quality Control. In this department, I worked assiduously to make sure that their product comformity is as to the standard of the regulation put in place for it. I had the opportunity of working and montitoring of some of the units that are under this department. These units include: water treament room, syrup room, CO<sub>2</sub> room, effulent unit, PET-bottle and glass-bottle production rooms.

                    Similarly, I had worked with Nazrul General Contracting in the area of project manager in their construction site in United Arab Emirates. Here, I and my team planned a detailed scope of achieving excellency in the construction site. We were able to mitigate some common health hazards associated with the construction work through adequate training and orientation of the workers on the importance of maintaining high standard health and environmental safety. I also helped in maintenance and procurement of the materials and its management.

                <h2>My Journey to IT</h2>
                <p>
                    I took the bold decision to learn software engineering after I heard Mr Strive Muyinwa the chairman of Econet communication talk about the importance of African youth to join the evolving thread of digital technology on his facebook page. I was confused at first on how to get started.

                    On a special occassion, I accedentally bump into one Ugandan friend at a bus station in Abu-Dhabi. On the course of our interaction he made mention that he works with an IT firm, and he suggested that I should go for IT and that I should start with React-js. Boom! that was what I needed to start my IT journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the line, another friend then became of great help by offerring me his Udemy account where he has resources on software engineering. I was learning with Udemy but my growth level on it was minimal. Hence, I opted to go deeper into it by registrating as a student with ALT Africa
